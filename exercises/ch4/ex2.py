# Implement the IntraCodec and all the necessary modules
# For each given quantization scale in the handout:
# - Initialize a new IntraCodec
# - Use lena_small to train Huffman coder of IntraCodec.
# - Compress and decompress 'lena.tif'
# - Measure bitrate and PSNR on lena
# Plot all the measurements in a Rate Distortion plot
